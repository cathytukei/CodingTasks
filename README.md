## Number Guessing Game

This is a practical coding task that implements a number guessing game in Python.

### Description

This program generates a random number between a specified range and allows the user to guess it within a set number of tries. The program provides feedback to the user after each guess, indicating if their guess is too high, too low, or correct. 

Learning to develop interactive programs like guessing games is important for understanding user input, conditional statements (if/else), loops (for/while), and basic game mechanics.

### Usage

1. Save this file as `number_guessing_game.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the program using `python number_guessing_game.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to guess the number within the allowed attempts.

**Note:**

* You can customize the game difficulty (number range, number of tries) by modifying the code within the script.
